Ghost of Tsushima has 19 Haiku Locations. Finding all Haiku is needed for the Body, Mind, and Spirit trophy. This guide shows all their locations.

None of the Haiku Collectibles are missable! It doesn’t matter what dialogue choices or what ending you pick during the story. You can still get all Haiku after the story in free-roam. You can reveal them on the map as question marks by liberating all of the Occupied Mongol Territories.

However, Haiku #10 at Hiyoshi Springs does not get marked on the map with a question mark. If you’re missing a Haiku it’s likely the hidden one at Hiyoshi Springs. The first two Haiku come from the story and aren’t marked either. The last Haiku comes from a Side Tale and likewise won’t show on the map.

To complete the Haiku you must interact with their marked position in the world and then pick from 3 poetry options (doesn’t matter which ones you pick). Haiku are a type of Japanese poetry. Each one of them also unlocks a Vanity Gear item (except the story/quest related ones). Two are automatic from the story, one is from Side Tale “The Proud Do Not Endure”.
