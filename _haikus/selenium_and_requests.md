Ever wondered to combine python-selenium and requests library. <br/>
Okay, firstly? Why? Why do I need to combine when I have selenium and requests both?
Selenium can access everything, and requests is super quick. Simple, isn't it.
Many time authorization token isn't accepted using requests headers, so why don't we use selenium to initialize the webpage, fire up the JS, and then request.
That's what I'm looking at, and trying to develop.
